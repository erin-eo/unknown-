 Hi, It's been three years since we went our separate ways, I haven't moved on. I'm just letting you live your life.

 Recently, you've been showing up in my dreams in a way thatfeels so real, and I didn't want to wake up. I might not reach out, but if you ever did, I'd reply instantly. I may not say good morning and good night anymore, but you're always the last thought I have before I drift off to sleep. 
 
 I'm trying to focus on myself, but the truth is, I miss youdeeply. I'd love to talk to you, but I know where to stand. I know my worth, and I won't forget that. You're always in my heart, and it will always have a place for you. 
Take care always, til next time, 

My Maria.ðŸ¦‹
